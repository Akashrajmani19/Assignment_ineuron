    "**<span style=\"font-size:larger;\">Answer 1</span>** : Functions are advantageous to have in programs for several reasons:           \n",
    "1. Reusability : Instead of writing the same code over and over again, we can define a function once and call it whenever needed. This promotes code reuse, improves maintainability, and reduces redundancy.\n",
    "2. Modularity : Functions break down complex programs into smaller, manageable chunks. Each function can represent a specific task or subtask within the program.    \n",
    "3. Code organization and maintainability : Functions help in structuring the codebase by providing a logical and organized way to group related functionality. With functions, we can divide your program into smaller, self-contained units, making it easier to navigate, debug, and maintain. If a bug or issue is found, we can focus on a specific function rather than searching through the entire program.      \n",
    "4. Code readability: Functions make the code more readable and self-explanatory. By using descriptive function names and properly defining the function's purpose, we can convey the intention of the code more effectively. This aids in understanding the program's functionality, even for someone who didn't write the code."

    "A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task or set of instructions. It encapsulates a series of operations and may take inputs as parameters and produce an output as return value. Functions are defined to provide reusability and modularity in a program. They are created using a function definition statement, such as def in Python, and contain the code that will be executed when the function is called.                \n",
    "On the other hand, a function call is an instruction that tells the program to execute a specific function at a certain point in the code. It invokes the execution of the function and passes any required arguments (values) to the function if it expects parameters. When a function is called, the program temporarily pauses its execution, jumps to the function's code block, executes the instructions within the function, and then returns to the point where the function was called to continue executing the remaining code.        \n",

It serves as a way for the function to provide a result or output that can be utilized by the calling code. By using a return statement, a function can send a specific value back to the caller, allowing further computation or actions to be based on that result.      \n",

The purpose of the try clause is to identify sections of code that may raise exceptions and handle them gracefully.
