OOP aims to organize code in a way that is more intuitive, maintainable, and scalable by representing entities and their interactions using objects and classes."

    "**<span style=\"font-size:larger;\">Answer 2</span>** : An object is a fundamental concept representing a real-world entity, data structure, or instance of a class. Everything in Python is an object, including simple data types (e.g., integers, strings) and more complex data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries). Additionally, user-defined classes are also objects."

They represent the state or characteristics of the object. Each object created from a class can have its own set of attribute values, allowing objects to have different states. Attributes are defined within the class and are shared by all instances of the class. We can access and modify an object's attributes using dot notation.                    \n",
    "**Methods**: Methods are functions defined within a class that define the behavior of the class. They represent actions or operations that can be performed by objects of the class. Methods can interact with and modify the object's attributes, and they can also return values. Like attributes, methods are shared by all instances of the class, but they can also access and modify instance-specific attributes."
