It is also known as an \"anoymus function\" because it dosen't requir a formal name like a regular function. Lambda functions are typically used when we need a simple function for a short period of time and don't want to define a separate function using the 'def' keyword.          \n",

    "**Single Expression**: Lambda functions can only contain a single expression. This means they can't include multiple statements or complex control flow structures. The expression is evaluated and the result is returned.                      \n",
